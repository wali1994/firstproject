*(Remember to replace `[your-username]` and `[your-repository-name]` with your actual GitHub details)*

## 🛠️ How It Works

The core logic is simple:
1.  The app contains a predefined list of lunch menu items (e.g., `["Pizza", "Sushi", "Burger", "Salad", "Tacos"]`).
2.  When the user clicks the "Generate" button, a JavaScript function is triggered.
3.  This function randomly selects an item from the list.
4.  The selected item is then dynamically displayed on the webpage, often with a fun animation.
